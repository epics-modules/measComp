    measComp Release Notes</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-1 (June 26, 2014)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for the new USB-CTR04/08 counter/timer modules. This includes support
      for the EPICS scaler record (similar to the Joerger VSC and SIS3820), and multi-channel
      scaler mode (similar to the SIS3820). This device can replace the SIS3820 in most
      applications for $429, which is less than 10% of the cost of the SIS3820.</li>
    <li>Updated from release 6.1 to 6.3 of the Measurement Computing Universal Library.</li>
    <li>Added dependency on synApps mca module for USB-CTR08 driver.</li>
    <li>Added more fields to the measCompAnalogIn_settings.req and measCompAnalogOut_settings.req
      files for save/restore.</li>
    <li>Added _RBV (readback) fields for pulse generator Period, Frequency, Width, and
      Delay since the requested value may not match the actual value due to hardware limitations.</li>
    <li>Add new demoSrc directory that contains a tutorial/demo on how to write a driver
      using asynPortDriver. The example is based on the USB-1608GX-2AO. It includes:
      <ul>
        <li>6 versions of the demo driver source code, starting with a very simple 132 line
          driver that just does 2 analog output records, and ending with the full driver that
          is 1255 lines and has waveform digitizer and waveform generator support, etc.</li>
        <li>A new iocMeasCompDemo directory with the various versions of the startup script.</li>
        <li>New medm files (measCompDemoTop.adl, 1608G_V[1,2,3,4,5].adl).</li>
        <li>New files in the documentation directory, measCompDriverTalk.pdf and measCompTutorial.pdf
          that were presented at an EPICS class on writing drivers based on asynPortDriver.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added the Run record to measCompPulseGen_settings.req, so it remembers the run/stop
      state.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-0 (Nov. 28, 2011)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>First release. Has support for USB-4303 and USB-1608GX-2AO.</li>
  </ul>
