    Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This package provides EPICS drivers for the some of the USB I/O modules from Measurement
    Computing. Currently the USB-CTR04/08 and USB-4303 counter/timer modules and the USB-1608G-2A0 analog
    input/output module are supported. Each of these drivers is documented separately.</p>

    <li><a href="measComp4303Doc.html">USB-4303 driver</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This module is currently only supported on Windows, with the win32-x86, windows-x64,
    and cygwin-x86 EPICS architectures. The driver uses the Measurement Computing "Universal
    Library", which is only available on Windows. Measurement Computing does not offer
    Linux support for the USB-CTR04/08 or USB-4303. They do have a new message based library they call
    DAQFlex, which runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. It currently only supports a few
    of their newer modules, including the USB-1608G series. The software architecture
    of this package is quite nice, and the source code for the drivers is provided.
    Unfortunately it is implemented in the C# programming language. C# is supported
    on Linux and Mac OSX with the "Mono" compiler package.&nbsp; My understanding is
    that it is difficult to call C# from C/C++, which is what the rest of EPICS is written
    in, and for this reason I have not used DAQFlex in this EPICS module. In principle
    one could rewrite the C# drivers in C++ and then use this new API with EPICS on
    Linux, Mac and other platforms that have an underlying USB library.</p>
